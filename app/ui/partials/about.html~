	    This is an OpenSource Video platform - OpenSV.  Imagine a tool where you can download and install your own node and setup a TV Station that gets integrated within a main broadcast network.  That, I think, is what OpenSV will become.  OpenSV.com will be the main distribution point for all OpenSV nodes in the network.  In addition to being linked into the OpenSV platform each node will behave on its own and will serve content to its own subset of viewers.
